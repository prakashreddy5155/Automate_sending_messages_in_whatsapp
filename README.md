# Automate_sending_messages_in_whatsapp

Hello guys ! 

THis is a python file which lets u to automate sending whatsapp messages with ur friends or with ur teachers or with any person, 
And you dont have to  wake @ 00:00 to wish ur friends during the birthday, just set at which time should it send the message and Boom !. THis will do the work for you.

NOTE: This is just for sending whatsapp messages and nothing more... 
      You cannot automate sending the message The day after tmrw. 
      This works for today and for the next day of today i,e., Tomorrow.

You can send messages to many people, but not an once,  you can send one after another.. 

You can specify different messages to different people or you can stick to the same message for all the people 


Rules : 

The time duration between one person to the another should be greater than 3 mins for optimal working. ex: 10:00 for first person and then message should not be 10:02 for the second one take 10:04 and then it will work, 
When someone already sent you a link or a youtube video and you automated to send to that person , then it will struggle to send the message , it ends up clicking the link or the video ,so make sure to send some messages before  or clear it . 

This is all about this .py file
